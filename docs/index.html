                <p>Since the end of the Cold War, the World has been witnessing a densification and complexification of the
                        conflicts involving a huge number of countries. From local conflicts to conflicts spanning entire
                        regions, the understanding of the depth and context of these events has been made more complex to
                        non-initiated people. In our work we will attempt to use data analysis tools and techniques to extract
                        meaningful information to help characterize and understand the main keys of those events.</p>
                <p>Our work will be based on the
                        <a href="http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/">UCDP dataset</a> that tracks conflicts since 1989, on the
                        <a href="http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/persons_of_concern">UNHCR dataset</a> (United Nations Human High Commissioner for Refugees), then we will use the
                        <a href="http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/persons_of_concern">GDP dataset
                        </a> of the UN and finally the
                        <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/2016-report">HDI dataset</a>.</p>
                <p>First of all we based our work on the UCDP(GED-171) dataset. The raw data is organized so that every line
                        in our dataframe represents an event. So we first of all grouped them by conflict, and aggregated
                        some of the related statistics. The dataframe we got gave us a wide list of all the events that occured
                        since 1989 across the world with the conflict id it is related to.</p>

                <img src='deadliest-conflicts.png' class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Deadliest conflicts">

                <p>The Rwanda conflict initiated in 1994 is, by far, the first one in terms of victims with more than 500,000
                        dead people in total. The conflict that follows does not even reach 200,000 victims.</p>
                <p>The first element we created to make it more meaningful and readable was an interactive timestamped map that
                        represents all the events that occurred since 1989 and every year since then. Clicking on an event
                        we are shown, in addition to the conflict id, the names of the two sides involved, the victims for
                        each of them and the total.</p>

                <button type="button" id="button0" class="btn btn-info btn-lg center-block" onclick="showMap(0)">Show map</button>
                <div id="map0"></div>
                <p>To this first map we add a heatmap. This map plots all the events that occured on the planet in function
                        of time, to show out the deadliest conflicts. We thus get a first approach on which regions of the
                        globe have been hurt the most.</p>

                <button type="button" id="button1" class="btn btn-info btn-lg center-block" onclick="showMap(1)">Show map</button>
        </div>
        <div id="map1"></div>
        <div class="container">
                <p>The first and obvious observation we make is that most of the conflicts reported since 1989 are located in
                        Africa, Middle-East, in the zone Afghanistan-Pakistan and India-Bangladesh and in Latin America (mostly
                        Colombia and Mexico).</p>
                <p>As the real point of interest in this analysis are the factions involved in the conflicts we created a dataframe
                        with one record per tuple and developped a network of sides where each node is a side and each edge
                        is an event involving these two sides.</p>
                <p>Plotting the degree distribution of the network of sides we realized that most of the factions fought against
                        one unique opponent.
                </p>

                <img src='degree-distribution-sides.png' class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Degree distribution of the network of sides">
                <p>In addition, to make our results even more readable we used a chord diagram that represents the top-30 deadliest
                        conflicts. In this diagram, for each continent, we link the factions between them where the size
                        of the link on the graph gets bigger as the number of victims grows. Pointing a faction on the side
                        circle gives the total number of victims this faction suffered and shows off the other factions it
                        is related to, through the links that light up in the center of the circle. Pointing, then, one of
                        those links in the center shows the name of the two factions involved in this conflict and the total
                        number of victims in this conflict.</p>

                <div id="chords-container" style="height:60vh;"></div>

                <p>The results shown by these graphs are that the factions that suffered the highest number of victims are EPLF
                        (Eritrean People's Liberation Front) in Africa, the Government of Afghanistan in Asia, the Government
                        of Iraq in Middle-East, the Government of Russia in Europe and the Government of Colombia in America.</p>
                <p>To show the relations between the events and the conflict they are related to, we created a network of distances
                        where each conflict location will be the centroid of all its events (mean longitude and latitude).
                        Each event will be linked to its respective conflict with an edge representing the distance to the
                        center of the conflict. Then, all conflicts will be linked together by an edge describing the distance.
                        The aim of this network is to find spatial relationship between various conflicts.</p>

        <div id="map5"></div>
        <div class="container">
                <h2>Conflicts and migrations</h2>
                <p>To make our analysis more consistent we added other datasets to our work. The first one is the UNHCR (United
                        Nations Human High Commissioner for Refugees) dataset. This dataset records the refugee data of the
                        UN that is a dataset relating the total number of refugees by country of departure/arrival and by
                        year. Our approach was to link and try to correlate those population displacements to the conflicts
                        that occurred across the planet. To this aim we created a first map representing both the conflicts
                        (just like the first map we created in this work) and the total population displacements by country
                        and by year. The total displacement choropleth represents people who left the country or moved inside
                        this same country. We had to deal with some missing data especially when we did not have the country
                        of origin of some immigrants. We made the choice to drop these data.</p>

                <button type="button" id="button2" class="btn btn-info btn-lg center-block" onclick="showMap(2)">Show map</button>
        </div>
        <div id="map2"></div>

        <div class="container">
                <p>The first observation we can make is that an important concentration of conflicts in a determined area does
                        not imply an important movement of population in the same time from the countries involved in those
                        conflicts. An example of this observation is Nigeria which is not involved in significant population
                        movements despite an important number of conflicts throughout the years. On the other hand, we see
                        that countries where important population movements are observed are almost always involved in major
                        (by major we mean a significant number) conflicts with important deaths. Thus, most important population
                        displacements seem to be created by the concentration of conflicts in the area.</p>

                <h2>Conflicts and economic indicators</h2>
                <p>Finally, to add another dimension to our observations, we try to find a potential correlation between the
                        conflicts we found and displayed, and the GDP(Gross Domestic products) and HDI(Human Development
                        Index). Such as with the population displacement seen previously we create two maps, one with the
                        gdp per country choropleth and the other one with the hdi per country choropleth.

        </div>
        <div class="container">
                <p>The main observations we can find from these maps is that most of the countries with a high HDI and GDP are
                        not involved in any (or at least just a few) conflicts. On the other hand many countries involved
                        in a lot and bloody conflicts have a low GDP, especially in Africa and Middle-East.</p>
